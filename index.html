        "I’ve wrestled with alligators,
        I’ve tussled with a whale.
        I done handcuffed lightning
        And throw thunder in jail.
        You know I’m bad.
        just last week, I murdered a rock,
        Injured a stone, Hospitalized a brick.
        I’m so mean, I make medicine sick.” - M. Ali
